# Movies-ETL
Amazing Prime hackathon work

## Purpose
The essence of this work was to learn Extract, Transform, Load or ETL process for collating data into useable forms.

## Results
Given three resources:
- Wikipedia movie data stored as a JSON
- Kaggle movie data
- Kaggle ratings data

The goal was to extract the data from the Wikipedia and Kaggle. Transformation involved cleaning each of the data files, joining the data together and then eliminating duplicate columns and columns with null data. Finally the data was loaded into a SQL database for use in a hackathon.

## Conclusion

The transform portion of ETL was the most iterative process. I found myself looking at the dataset each time I made a change in order to track the quality of the date.
